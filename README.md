- I completed this assignment individually. 
- No code was shared with or received from other students.
- Primary sources: the Project 3 spec and starter utilities provided by the instructor; course lecture notes; C++ reference for <filesystem>, <vector>, <string>, <algorithm>, <iomanip>, and <optional>.
- Any third-party materials were used only for API clarification (e.g., cppreference for standard library functions). No external libraries were used.
